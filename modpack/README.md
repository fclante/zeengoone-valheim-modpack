# ZeenGoone Valheim Server - Official Modpack

This is the official modpack for the ZeenGoone Server. It is a collection of mods that we have tested and found to be compatible with each other. We have also made some changes to the mods to make them more balanced and to make the game more fun.

## Greylisted Mods

> Greylisted mods are entirely optional and are not included in the official modpack. They are mods that we have tested and found to be compatible with the official modpack. However, they may not be as balanced as the mods in the official modpack.
